# ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º 4.0  ETX SPORTS METAVERSE

The Metaverse is built and developed so that the virtual world continues to evolve. Users can build their own streets and buildings, as well as create signs, parks, and even new things that donâ€™t exist in our reality. Gigantic light spectacles or oversized buildings and areas in which the laws of physics as we know them seem to be suspended. In order to understand the impact the Metaverse will have on sports, one must first understand what the Metaverse is in the first place. Because after Facebookâ€™s admittedly clever move to name itself after the Metaverse, there is a lot of confusion about the actual background and technology.\
\
Many people who do not work in the industry still consider this Metaverse definition to be very abstract and dreams of the future that are still several decades away. However, the Metaverse is already in its infancy and it has already been shown several times that the vision has long since become reality.\
\
Innovative technologies, such as cryptocurrencies and blockchain, have extremely simplified the progress of the Metaverse in recent years. These allow, even across different providers, the continuity of data in the Metaverse. NFTs are the best example of how blockchain technology can be used to verify ownership of digital assets, and there are already 3D virtual reality platforms that take advantage of this technology.\
\
If you are now legitimately wondering what exactly sport has to do with all these explanations, you are certainly not alone. But the answer to this question is not trivial. Because on the one hand, traditional sports somehow have nothing at all to do with the Metaverse world, but on the other hand, the world of sports will fundamentally change as a result.\
