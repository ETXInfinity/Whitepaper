# ðŸŽ² 6.0  ETX INFINITY BETTING PLATFORM

Through sponsorship and advertising, the gambling industry has successfully and deeply hitched itself to the worldâ€™s most popular game. Legal sports betting has gone mainstream around the world and dozens of states have legalized it. Currently a multibillion-dollar betting boom is afoot. More money is now wagered on which may become the biggest market of all. As betting expands, the boundaries that once separated gambling from sports media and professional sports leagues are disappearing. This industry is poised for explosive growth in the next coming years and ETX Infinity is on the verge of creating its unique betting site.

For decades, sports betting was an add-on at most casinos. It added to the flavour of the place, but the real action (and revenue) was at slot machines, keno, roulette and other table games. Now, sports betting is surging. Digital betting has been behind this surge. Like many online activities, it got a huge boost from the Covid-19 lockdowns in which people were now dealing with their social lives online. Half of the Premier Leagueâ€™s 20 clubs in England have a gambling sponsor on their shirt and the proportion rises to 17 out of 24 among clubs in the Championship, which is itself sponsored by Sky Bet.
