# 8.3 Validator Node Deployment

## Truffle

## Using Truffle <a href="#using-truffle" id="using-truffle"></a>

### Setting up the development environment <a href="#setting-up-the-development-environment" id="setting-up-the-development-environment"></a>

There are a few technical requirements before we start. Please install the following: Requirements:

* Windows, Linux or Mac OS X
* [Node.js v8.9.4 LTS or later](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

**Recommendations for Windows**

If you're running Truffle on Windows, you may encounter some naming conflicts that could prevent Truffle from executing properly. Please see the section on resolving naming conflicts for solutions.

### Installing <a href="#installing" id="installing"></a>

Once we have those installed, we only need one command to install Truffle:

```
npm install -g truffle
```



To verify that Truffle is installed properly, type **`truffle version`** on a terminal. If you see an error, make sure that your npm modules are added to your path.

### Create A Project <a href="#create-a-project" id="create-a-project"></a>

The first step is to create a Truffle project. We'll use the \*MegaCoin as an example, which creates a token that can be transferred between accounts:

* Create a new directory for your Truffle project

```
mkdir ETX-Node-example
cd ETX-Node-example
```

Intialize your project

```
truffle init
```

Once this operation is completed, you'll now have a project structure with the following items:

* contracts/: Directory for Solidity contracts
* migrations/: Directory for scriptable deployment files
* test/: Directory for test files for testing your application and contracts
* truffle-config.js: Truffle configuration file

#### Create Contract <a href="#create-contract" id="create-contract"></a>

You can write your own smart contract or download the ETX20 token smart contract template.

#### Compile Contract <a href="#compile-contract" id="compile-contract"></a>

To compile a Truffle project, change to the root of the directory where the project is located and then type the following into a terminal:

```
truffle compile
```

#### Config Truffle for TC <a href="#config-truffle-for-tc" id="config-truffle-for-tc"></a>

* Go to truffle-config.js
* Update the truffle-config with nc-network-crendentials.

```
const HDWalletProvider = require('@truffle/hdwallet-provider');
const fs = require('fs');
const mnemonic = fs.readFileSync(".secret").toString().trim();

module.exports = {
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",     // Localhost (default: none)
      port: 8545,            // Standard ETX port (default: none)
      network_id: "*",       // Any network (default: none)
    },
    testnet: {
      provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, `https://testnet.etxinfinity.com`),
      network_id: 97,
      confirmations: 10,
      timeoutBlocks: 200,
      skipDryRun: true
    },
    bsc: {
      provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, `https://mainnet.etxinfinity.com`),
      network_id: 56,
      confirmations: 10,
      timeoutBlocks: 200,
      skipDryRun: true
    },
  },

  // Set default mocha options here, use special reporters etc.
  mocha: {
    // timeout: 100000
  },

  // Configure your compilers
  compilers: {
    solc: {
      version: "^0.6.12", // A version or constraint - Ex. "^0.5.0"
    }
  }
}

```

Notice, it requires mnemonic to be passed in for Provider, this is the seed phrase for the account you'd like to deploy from. Create a new .secret file in root directory and enter your 12 word mnemonic seed phrase to get started. To get the seedwords from metamask wallet you can go to Metamask Settings, then from the menu choose Security and Privacy where you will see a button that says reveal seed words.

### Deploying on ETX Network <a href="#deploying-on-dnd-network" id="deploying-on-dnd-network"></a>

Run this command in root of the project directory:

```
$ truffle migrate --network testnet
```

Contract will be deployed on ETX Chapel Testnet, it look like this:

```

## Hardcat

### What is Hardhat <a href="#what-is-hardhat" id="what-is-hardhat"></a>

Hardhat is a development environment to compile, deploy, test, and debug your smart contract.

### Setting up the development environment <a href="#setting-up-the-development-environment" id="setting-up-the-development-environment"></a>

There are a few technical requirements before we start. Please install the following: Requirements:

### Installing <a href="#installing" id="installing"></a>

There are a few technical requirements before we start. Please install the following: Requirements:

* Windows, Linux or Mac OS X
* [Node.js v8.9.4 LTS or later](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

First, you need to create an empty project `npm init --yes`

Once your project is ready, you should run

```
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

It's recommeded to install some dependencies.

```
npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers
```

To use your local installation of Hardhat, you need to use `npx` to run it (i.e. `npx hardhat`).

### Create A Project <a href="#create-a-project" id="create-a-project"></a>

To create your Hardhat project run npx hardhat in your project folder:

```
mkdir node
cd node
```

* Intialize your project:

```
$ npx hardhat

Welcome to Hardhat v2.0.8

? What do you want to do? …
❯ Create a sample project
  Create an empty hardhat.config.js
  Quit
```

Once this project is initialized, you'll now have a project structure with the following items:

* contracts/: Directory for Solidity contracts
* scripts/: Directory for scriptable deployment files
* test/: Directory for test files for testing your application and contracts
* hardhat-config.js: Hardhat configuration file

#### Create Contract <a href="#create-contract" id="create-contract"></a>

You can write your own smart contract or using template in openzeplin

#### Config Hardhat for TC <a href="#config-hardhat-for-tc" id="config-hardhat-for-tc"></a>

* Go to hardhat.config.js
* Update the config with nc-network-crendentials.

```
